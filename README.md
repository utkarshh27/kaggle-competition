# Kaggle Competitions Notebooks

This repository contains my solutions and approaches to various Kaggle competitions. Each notebook is a self-contained solution to a specific competition, detailing the steps taken to preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Repository Structure

Each competition has its own directory, named after the competition. Inside each directory, you'll find a Jupyter notebook that contains the code and a detailed explanation of the steps taken.

## Competitions

Here are some of the competitions included in this repository:

- Feature Imputation with a Heat Flux Dataset
- Explore Multi-Label Classification with an Enzyme Substrate Dataset
- Regression with a Crab Age Dataset
- Binary Classification of Machine Failures
- Forecasting Mini-Course Sales
- Kaggle - LLM Science Exam
- Digit Recognizer
## Installation

To run these notebooks, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
